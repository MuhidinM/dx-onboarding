          The key to overcoming poverty lies in the power of cooperation and
          cooperatives", as envisioned by Obbo Haile Gebre Lube, the founding
          father of CoopBank. He recognized the struggles and neglect faced by
          rural and underprivileged communities.

          Inspired by his vision, we believe that a better tomorrow for our
          community rests in the hands of young innovators from these very
          communities. That's why we are committed to cooperating with them to
          transform lives and create lasting change.
